# AstroSpect-Photometric-Redshift-Estimation-for-Celestial-Bodies
AstroSpect is a deep learning project for estimating celestial redshifts from photometric data using a custom CNN. It automates distance prediction, improving accuracy and scalability over traditional spectral methods. Trained on SDSS data, it enables efficient, real-time analysis of large astronomical datasets.
